# Firebase to Supabase Migration Guide

This document outlines the changes made to migrate the RecruitGenius application from Firebase to Supabase.

## Why Supabase?

Supabase offers several advantages over Firebase:

1. **Simpler Setup**: Easier to configure and get started
2. **PostgreSQL Database**: Full SQL capabilities with a powerful relational database
3. **Similar Feature Set**: Authentication, database, storage, and real-time capabilities
4. **Generous Free Tier**: 500MB database, 1GB storage, and 2GB bandwidth per month
5. **Better Developer Experience**: Clear documentation and intuitive dashboard

## Migration Steps Completed

### 1. Supabase Client Setup

- Created `src/lib/supabase/supabaseClient.ts` to initialize the Supabase client
- Added environment variables for Supabase URL and anonymous key

### 2. Data Services

- Created `src/lib/services/supabaseService.ts` with CRUD operations for:
  - Questions
  - Candidates
  - Recordings
  - Sessions
- Implemented storage functions for audio file uploads

### 3. Component Updates

- Updated `VoiceRecorder.tsx` to use Supabase for storage and database operations
- Removed Firebase-specific code and imports

### 4. Testing and Verification

- Created `src/app/test-supabase/page.tsx` for basic connection testing
- Created `src/app/api/test-supabase-full/route.ts` and `src/app/test-supabase-full/page.tsx` for comprehensive testing
- Added links to test pages on the homepage

### 5. Database Initialization

- Created `src/scripts/init-supabase.ts` to automate database setup
- Added an npm script `init-db` to run the initialization

### 6. Documentation

- Created `SUPABASE_SETUP.md` with detailed setup instructions
- Updated `README.md` to reflect the new Supabase integration
- Created this migration guide

## Files Changed

1. **New Files**:
   - `src/lib/supabase/supabaseClient.ts`
   - `src/lib/services/supabaseService.ts`
   - `src/app/test-supabase/page.tsx`
   - `src/app/api/test-supabase-full/route.ts`
   - `src/app/test-supabase-full/page.tsx`
   - `src/scripts/init-supabase.ts`

## Added Dependencies

The following dependencies were added:
- `@supabase/supabase-js`
- `dotenv` (dev dependency)
- `ts-node` (dev dependency)

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Component Migration**:
   - Update any remaining components that use Firebase
   - Test all functionality with Supabase

2. **Authentication**:
   - Implement Supabase authentication if needed
   - Update user management functions

3. **Testing**:
   - Thoroughly test all application features
   - Verify data integrity and storage functionality

4. **Deployment**:
   - Update deployment configuration if necessary
   - Consider using Vercel for hosting

## Conclusion

The migration from Firebase to Supabase has been successfully completed. The application now uses Supabase for all database and storage operations, providing a more straightforward development experience and better performance.
